Parse and gather data over multiple git projects.

Done:

* Authors per project
* Number of commits over time
* Gems uses if there is a gemfile
* Language used (guess)

Todo:

* Active authors this month
* Newly added libs (gems, python packages, etc)
* Open pull requests over time (from github)
* How to deal with branches?  Assume master?
